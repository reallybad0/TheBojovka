(RPG) as in, *Really Pathetic Game*
### The Story
Imagine you are kid that's taking the courage path through the forest. You are supposed to follow the candles, which you do, when suddently, boom.
No candles to be seen anywhere. It's the night time, and you're getting really scared of the sounds around you, and since you really lost your way 
down in the forest, you decide to follow the path you choose. Right or Left? Right or Wrong? That's all upon you! Run into scary creatures and manage
to get throught the forest alive!
### The Development
I put a lot of effort into this game, really wanted to see it done and took care of it as if it was my very own baby. Of course I did a lotta work
last minute, but that was the best pre-deadline 72 hours I've spent. I was really happy about the final product, altought it had a ton of mistakes.
I was looking forward to fix them, but I felt like that game could easily work even with the bugs in it. And since people have supported me on my 
way throught this game, I felt like in my life I have finally created something that isn't completely ðŸ’©.
### The Failure
So as the deadline occurs, I get offered week more to work on my game, which I take and I spend the next week working my ass on the game. I fix the 
worst of the issues, and I have reallly good feeling about it. But THEN, a week after the deadline, I find out my work for the past week, my story of an ugly 
duckling turning into beautiful (okay, not so beautiful) swan, was basically cut and ended before the duckling could even evolve into the swan. They checked,
graded, and judged my work before it was at least enough for me. And they told me why it wasn't fixed another week later, when it has been fixed
ages ago. 
#### The Aftermath
I felt betrayed, and immediately deicded to burn the project to ashes, as they already said it was shit, and I no longer wanted anything
to do with it. I didn't want anyone to see it, didn't want them to see the final version, because why would they, really. I just want nothing to 
do with it anymore, because it's just another proof that no matter how hard I try, I always end up dissapointing everyone (myself included) and letting
everyone down (myself included) 
###### TLDR; I'm a piece of ðŸ’© and don't be expecting updates anytime soon
